Area Editor
===========

Diku/Rom Area Editor

This repository was forked from georgefrick/mafia, and was originally developed for Animud (https://animud.net).  Changes
from that repo are mostly minor for compatibility with Age of Legacy (http://ageoflegacy.com).

This is a Swing implementation of an area editor for Roms, that could easily work for Diku or any other type of mud with some modifications.

This code is provided as is, though emails and messages about it are welcome.

Happy Mudding/Building! :-)
